								<h2>WEBSITE MAINTENANCE SERVICE</h2>
								<p>
									Most WordPress updates are for security fixes. Some are feature enhancements, and some are cosmetic fixes. All should be done in a timely manner to keep your site safe from hacking, and to give your customers the best possible experience on your website. I assume the reason you’re not keeping up with your site is because, like most small business owners, you’re busy running your business.
									I will perform all of your WordPress updates, and will perform monthly backups of your website, to protect your website in the event of a catastrophe.
